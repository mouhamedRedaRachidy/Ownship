# Oblien edge-routing requirements (for openship cloud / SaaS)

**Audience:** Oblien platform team.
**Why:** openship parses each repo's `vercel.json` routing config and, on **self-hosted**,
compiles it to OpenResty so a deployment behaves like Vercel — one domain serving static
assets at `/` and reverse-proxying a backend at `/api/*`, plus redirects/headers. On **cloud
(Oblien)** there is no OpenResty, so this config is currently **persisted but not applied**.
This doc specifies the edge capabilities Oblien needs so openship can compile the *same* config
to Oblien and reach parity. openship already has the parser, the persisted config, and a pure
compiler abstraction; only a **cloud emitter** is missing on our side, gated on the API below.

**Scope note:** this reproduces the documented `vercel.json`/Netlify **routing config**
semantics — NOT a serverless-functions runtime. openship proxies a long-running backend
service; it does not run per-file functions.

## IMPORTANT: this is DOMAIN/DEPLOYMENT-level routing, not a "Pages" feature

The routing table must attach to a **domain / deployment**, not only to a static Page.
openship cloud deployments come in several shapes, and all of them need edge routing:

| Deployment shape | Entry | Routing need |
|---|---|---|
| **Static-only** (Vite/CRA SPA) | a Page | SPA fallback, redirects, headers |
| **Server-only** (Express/Next API) | a **VM — no Page at all** | redirects, headers, path routing to the VM |
| **Monorepo** (static + server, e.g. Express + Vite) | **one domain over BOTH** a Page (static `/`) and a VM (`/api/*`) | proxy `/api/*` → VM, serve `/` static |
| **Compose** (N services) | one domain | path-route to several VM origins |

So each **rule's action** must be able to target: a **static artifact** (a Page/CDN bundle),
an **arbitrary origin** (a VM/service URL), or a **redirect** — independent of whether the
deployment "is a Page." A static site is just the case where the primary action serves a Page;
a server app is where it proxies a VM; a monorepo mixes both on one domain. **Do not scope the
routing table under the Pages product** — key it on the deployment/domain, or server-only and
compose deployments can never get routing and the monorepo case only works by accident (static
being the primary). Building it Pages-only now means a rework later.

## The one critical primitive

**Pages must reverse-proxy a path pattern to an arbitrary backend origin, on the same domain as
the static site.** Vercel (rewrites → functions/external URL), Cloudflare (Pages Functions /
`_redirects` 200-proxy) and Netlify (`status=200` proxy) all have this. Without it,
"static frontend + backend API on one domain" is impossible on cloud. Everything else is
secondary.

## Capabilities

### A. Per-deployment routing table
An **ordered** list of rules attached to a Page/deployment, evaluated at the edge per request.
openship sets it at deploy time. Requirements:
- **Atomic replace** on redeploy — a deploy's rules fully supersede the prior set (no partial state).
- **Scoped to the deployment** so rollback restores that deployment's rules.
- Idempotent; returns the applied config.

### B. Rule = match → action
**Match** — path pattern supporting: **exact** (`/old`), **prefix** (`/api/`), and
**wildcard/param** (`/api/*`, `:path*`, `(.*)`) with capture groups.

**Actions** (priority order):
1. **proxy → origin URL** — *must-have, the critical one.* `/api/* → https://<backend-origin>`,
   URL unchanged; forward method/body/query/headers; stream responses; ideally websocket
   upgrade; configurable keep/strip prefix (Vercel keeps).
2. **rewrite → static path** — serve a different asset, URL unchanged (powers SPA fallback
   `/* → /index.html`).
3. **redirect** — status `301/302/307/308` + destination, with capture-group substitution.
4. **response headers** — add/override headers for matching paths.
5. flags: **cleanUrls** (strip `.html`), **trailingSlash** (enforce/strip).

### C. Origin registration
A way to tell Pages the backend origin URL (the deployed backend VM/service). Inline in the
proxy rule (`origin: https://…`) is simplest; a separate `origins` registry referenced by rules
also works.

### D. Domain / TLS
One managed (`*.opsh.io`) or custom domain serving **both** static and proxied paths, with
automatic TLS (Pages already does TLS — it just needs to coexist with proxy rules).

### E. Matching semantics — documented + deterministic
State the evaluation order (first-match-wins vs longest-prefix) and the precedence between
redirects / rewrites / filesystem (Vercel: redirects → rewrites → filesystem → catch-all).
openship will emit rules in whatever order you specify.

### F. Non-functional
- Rule-count + value-length limits.
- Treat rule values as **data, not config** — they originate from untrusted repos. openship
  sanitizes at compile time, but the edge should too (reject control chars / injection).
- Per-rule hit logging is a nice-to-have.

## Suggested API shape (openship-facing)

Key the routing table on the **deployment / domain**, not on a Page:

```
PUT deployments/{id}/routes          // (or domains/{host}/routes) — atomic full replace
{
  routes: [
    // proxy a path to an arbitrary origin (a VM/service) — the critical primitive
    { match: { path: "/api/(.*)", type: "wildcard" },
      action: { kind: "proxy", origin: "https://backend-vm:3000", stripPrefix?: false } },
    { match: { path: "/old", type: "exact" },
      action: { kind: "redirect", status: 308, to: "/new" } },
    { match: { path: "/(.*)" },
      action: { kind: "headers", set: [{ key: "X-Frame-Options", value: "DENY" }] } },
    // serve a static artifact (a Page/CDN bundle) — SPA fallback
    { match: { path: "/(.*)" },
      action: { kind: "static", target: "index.html" } }
  ],
  cleanUrls?: boolean,
  trailingSlash?: boolean
}
```
Action `kind` is one of `proxy` (→ any origin URL), `static` (→ a Page/CDN artifact),
`redirect`, `rewrite`, `headers` — so the SAME table works for static-only, server-only,
monorepo, and compose deployments. Return the applied config; idempotent; a version pinned to
the openship deployment so rollback restores that deployment's routes.

---

## How openship maps to it (already built on our side)

openship parses `vercel.json` → a normalized `RoutingConfig`
(`rewrites`/`redirects`/`headers`/`cleanUrls`/`trailingSlash`), persists it on the project, and
compiles it — today to OpenResty (`compileVercelRouting`, self-hosted). To light up cloud we add
one **cloud emitter** over the SAME `RoutingConfig`, mapping:
- `rewrites` (dest = path/function) → `proxy` to backend origin · (dest = `/index.html`) →
  `rewrite` · (dest = full URL) → `proxy` to that URL
- `redirects` → `redirect` · `headers` → `headers` · `cleanUrls`/`trailingSlash` → flags

So self-hosted (OpenResty locations) and cloud (Oblien routes) become two emitters over one
parsed config — genuine parity.

---

## MVP (phaseable)

1. **proxy-to-origin** (C + action #1) — mandatory.
2. static **rewrite / SPA fallback** (#2) — mandatory.
3. **redirects** (#3) + **headers** (#4).
4. Later: `cleanUrls`/`trailingSlash`; conditional matching (Vercel `has`/`missing`); per-rule logging.

Items 1–2 alone deliver the Vercel "static + `/api`" single-domain behavior on cloud; item 3
rounds out the common `vercel.json`.

## Service-to-service networking (compose / monorepo backends)

Separate from edge routing: a multi-service deployment (docker-compose, or a monorepo whose
frontend proxies to a backend) needs its workspaces to reach **each other** internally — e.g. the
frontend calling `http://api:3000`. On native Docker this is automatic (embedded DNS + shared
network). On Oblien each service is its own workspace on the internal `10.x` network, so openship
must wire three things, and **all three are required** for a call to connect:

1. **Source rule — `private_link_ids` (directed).** Adding workspace A to B's `private_link_ids`
   authorizes **A → B** (one-way). openship sets every service's list to all its peers, so the
   mesh is bidirectional.
2. **Port rule — `ingress_ports`.** A private link does **NOT** open any port. Per Oblien's
   firewall, *"traffic is dropped unless all match … Port is in the `ingress_ports` list — only
   ports you explicitly open are reachable."* So **each service's own listen port must also be in
   its `ingress_ports`**, or a linked peer's connection is silently dropped. openship opens each
   service's port here (`syncServiceDiscovery`) alongside the link — a link without the matching
   port open is the classic footgun.
3. **Name resolution — `/etc/hosts`.** There is **no internal DNS**, so a hostname like `api`
   does not resolve on its own. openship `exec`s into each workspace and writes
   `<peer-ip> <service-name>` lines to `/etc/hosts` so `http://api:3000` resolves to the peer's
   internal IP.

**Ask for the Oblien team:** the source/port/DNS split is currently only discoverable by reading
`workspace-networking.md` closely, and internal hostname resolution isn't documented at all. Two
concrete improvements would make this "clear end-to-end": (a) document that a private link leaves
the target port closed unless it's in `ingress_ports` (state it at the private-link API, not only
in the firewall concepts page), and (b) document (or provide) internal name resolution so callers
don't have to hand-roll `/etc/hosts`. Ideally, linking two workspaces for a known service port
would open that port and register the name in one call.
