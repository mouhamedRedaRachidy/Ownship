/**
 * Rate-limit types — Store backend + Policy descriptor.
 *
 * The Store is a tiny primitive: given a key + window + limit, atomically
 * return whether this request is allowed and how many remain. Two
 * backends mirror cache-store's pattern: in-memory (process-local) and
 * Redis (shared across replicas).
 *
 * The algorithm is sliding-window-counter — a weighted blend of the
 * current and previous fixed windows that approximates a true sliding
 * window with O(1) state per key. Cloudflare's published approach.
 * Mathematically:
 *
 *   estimated_rate(now)
 *     = count_in_current_window
 *     + count_in_previous_window * (1 - elapsed_in_current_window / window)
 *
 * Smooths the classic fixed-window boundary burst (e.g. 100 reqs at
 * t=59s and 100 more at t=61s) at the cost of slight over-rejection
 * near the boundary — preferable to under-rejection from a security
 * standpoint.
